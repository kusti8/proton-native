# Contribution Guide

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, and install dependencies with `npm i`. To test changes, make changes to `testprog.js` and run `npm run testprog`. Just don't commit any changes to this file.

### Docs

All documentation is housed in `docs/`, and is written in Markdown. Follow the format for all other pages. If you're making a page that doesn't follow previous formats, ask me. Changes made to `index.html` will not be made lightly and 99% of cases don't need to change that. The format is set for documentation, so don't try and change it.

## Important Points

Proton Native welcomes contributions to constantly improve. Contributions are accepted in the form of a PR, which has a few important points that should be followed.

1.  Styling is done with prettier. A git-hook has been added for convience, but any PR that isn't styled won't be accepted.

2.  Follow common sense. If there already exists a file similar, use it as a template. Don't make up your own style.

3.  Minimize hacks. If there's a clean way to do it, do it.

4.  **Document everything**! Every additional feature should be well documented.
