# Window

The window is the basis where all other components reside.

The following example creates a simple window, of size 500x500.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { render, Window, App } from 'proton-native';

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <App>
        <Window title="Example" size={{w: 500, h: 500}} />
      </App>
    );
  }
}

render(<Example />);
```
