# Debugging

## react-devtools

Currently, Proton Native allows you to use `react-devtools` to debug your code out of the box.

It works automatically if you:

* Have `react-devtools-core` installed (directly or as a dependency of `react-devtools`)
* Have `react-devtools` running

It will not work if `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`.
